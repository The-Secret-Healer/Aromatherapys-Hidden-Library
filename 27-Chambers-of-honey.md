## Developmental Note

During a previous collaboration with Sacred Soul Holistics, Elizabeth Ashley authored a 22-chakra framework.  
The system has since evolved into the **27 Chambers of Honey**, which stands as the definitive and current expression of the method. Earlier models belong to the developmental history of the work; present instruction is rooted in this expanded architecture of the energy centres and light bodies within her Melissa work and *Luminous Garments*.
