#98 Mugwort

ELIZABETH: Hello and welcome to the 98th episode of Fellowship in Essential Oils. Today we are diving into another oil of one of our favourite families, the Artemisia, and we're also going to talk about another hazardous oil. Why do we keep doing this? By the end of the episode, we hope you love this oil as much as we do.

ADAM: Mugwort‚Äîhow are you, Liz?

ELIZABETH: I love Artemisia oils. I really think I should write a book just on them. People have asked if we‚Äôll do this Artemisia, and yes, we will. Mugwort is a magical plant. It‚Äôs always cited in magical practice, but you rarely hear about the essential oil. When I qualified‚Äîback when dinosaurs roamed the earth‚Äîwe were told this was a hazardous oil. But if you look it up in Tisserand and Young, the maximum dilution is 2%, which isn't that low. So the key is understanding why it was classed as hazardous, and why we need to be careful with it. It‚Äôs a really lovely plant and oil.

ADAM: I‚Äôm going to be honest, I love my Artemisia oils but don‚Äôt have Mugwort in my collection. How would you describe its aroma?

ELIZABETH: It‚Äôs closely related to Wormwood, which has a very bitter smell. Mugwort is softer, powdery‚Äînot quite floral, but herbaceous and sweeter than Wormwood. You wouldn‚Äôt choose it for perfume, but for its properties.

ADAM: Physically, it‚Äôs hazardous, so what situations should people avoid it?

ELIZABETH: Let‚Äôs start with your sense of its physical use.

ADAM: Most authors are hesitant to discuss it physically, though some mention cramping or muscles.

ELIZABETH: Yes, it‚Äôs used against stagnant Qi in Chinese medicine‚Äîmoves stuck things, warms, relieves dampness. Historically, John Gerard wrote that the traveller with Mugwort tied about them felt no weariness and was protected from poisons and wild beasts. As a medicine, Mugwort moves things. Its main use is as an emmenagogue‚Äîbringing on delayed periods, helping labour, expelling afterbirth. So it‚Äôs absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy.

We don‚Äôt know the effects of essential oils on the unborn fetus because testing would be unethical. Herbalism guides us: don‚Äôt use in pregnancy.

It‚Äôs also useful for things like retention of urine because it moves things. Energetically, it softens boundaries, disincarnates.

Main constituents include camphor, sabinene, and thujone‚Äîthujone can be neurotoxic, linked to delusions or hallucinations, so not for people with schizophrenia or psychosis.

ADAM: So traditionally used to assist in labour, periods, and urination?

ELIZABETH: Yes, though we wouldn‚Äôt use essential oils in pregnancy now. Post-miscarriage, I‚Äôve used it in extremely low dilution (0.25%) in cases where other oils like Clary Sage hadn‚Äôt worked. But really, Mugwort is about dreams, divination, magic‚Äînot regular physical medicine.

ADAM: That gentleness in letting go and surrendering shows up spiritually too, right?

ELIZABETH: The theme word for Mugwort is flow‚Äîflow of menstruation, intuition, dreams. It breaks down the concrete reality.

ADAM: It‚Äôs protective too, guiding you safely into those states.

ELIZABETH: Exactly. But it‚Äôs crucial to know what you‚Äôre seeking before using it‚Äîwrite it down. Otherwise you get lost in a sea of visions.

ADAM: Would you diffuse it, anoint, or bath?

ELIZABETH: Bath is my favourite, but anointing the brow or back of neck works well. Low dilution, strategic placement. Write down what you want to achieve and record your dreams before you get out of bed.

ADAM: Astrological links‚Äîwould you say Pisces?

ELIZABETH: Culpeper says Venus, ruling Taurus and Libra. We‚Äôll put the astrological notes in the description.

ADAM: But energetically, we‚Äôd say Moon and Neptune‚Äîdreamy, flowy, intuitive.

ELIZABETH: Agreed.

ADAM: So chakras‚Äîbrow and sacral?

ELIZABETH: Yes, brow for intuition, sacral for menstrual flow.

ADAM: Lymphatics or water retention?

ELIZABETH: It could help but safer oils like Cypress or Juniper are better.

ADAM: So Mugwort is more for serious spiritual practice, not everyday use.

ELIZABETH: Exactly‚Äîused sparingly and wisely.

ADAM: Also used in cleansing crystals‚Äîspritzing during full moon cleansing rituals.

ELIZABETH: Yes, Artemis, goddess of the moon, connects here‚Äîgreat for intention activation.

ADAM: Also used historically to reduce fatigue, placed in shoes.

ELIZABETH: Gerard says it makes the traveller tireless.

ADAM: And associated with love magic, but perhaps more poetic than medicinal.

ELIZABETH: Yes, and we love hearing comments below.

ADAM: Don‚Äôt forget to like and subscribe. We‚Äôll see you next week for another episode of Fellowship in Essential Oils.

ELIZABETH: Take care and blessed be.
