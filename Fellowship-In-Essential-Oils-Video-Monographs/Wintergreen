## Full Transcript

Adam Barallet: Hello and welcome to the 99th episode of Fellowship in Essential Oils. For those of you that have followed us through this journey, we hope that you've enjoyed learning about all these amazing essential oils. And today we're actually talking about one that I have a bit of a close relationship with, and when we were kind of making sure we'd done all the important essential oils, we realized we'd actually missed it.

Today we're exploring Wintergreen. How I you today, Liz, 

Elizabeth Ashley: I'm really looking forward to this, but I am. Kind of a bit too chilled because I've been inhaling too much Winter Green, so don't expect a huge amount of information on me. But I'm interested to know why do ~you have~ a relationship with Winter Green Essential Oil?

Adam Barallet: So obviously I work with doTERRA Essential Oils and one of the, um, advantages I've had with being involved with them for over a decade now is, ~uh, ~several years ago, ~um, ~I don't know if you remember, but there was this massive earthquake that kind of struck Nepal and a lot of the rural areas were [00:01:00] actually really destroyed and a lot of homes were destroyed.

~Um, and ~as part of doTERRA's Healing Hands, which is their charitable arm, we were actually flown there to ~actually ~help to do some work. Helping to rebuild a hospital and, ~uh, ~Vanessa Jean, ~um, ~who I wrote, ~um, ~gifts to essential oils with, she'd actually been over there previously to help rebuild a school that had collapsed and different things like that as well.

The reason we do that is because in that area we actually also source our winter green essential oils. So as well as doing some hard labor and helping to rebuild a hospital, ~um, ~we were actually able to, ~um. ~See how it's actually sourced. So winter green is wild harvested in Nepal. So basically the women will go up into the forest, up into the mountains and they carry the winter green in these bags.

And it's really interesting there, these big Hessian bags. They put the strap around their head and then throw it behind them. Now we saw the women kind of emerge out of the forest as they'd finished their harvest. They do it early in the morning. The kids go to school, they do it in the morning, then they can be home in the afternoon [00:02:00] for the children.

~Um, ~and they dumped these bags and, and you know, so on. We were actually given the opportunity then to pick that up and to see how heavy it actually was. Now I squat down, I put it over my head. I go to stand up. And I can't, it was that frigging heavy that, but it, the, the mu the neck muscles that these women must have.

And some of them would have a child strapped to their front and the winter green on their back. So, so hard working, which really makes you appreciate this little brown bottles that we have. ~Um, ~and then we saw it. The leaves were taken, they were weighed, the women were paid on the spot and then they took them straight to the, ~um, ~the still.

And dam packed them and started sending that, ~um, ~steam through there. And we saw the beautiful oil and of course the Nepalese, ~um, ~winter green, the oil actually comes out a soft pink color, which is really, really, ~um, ~interesting to see as well. So being able to ~see, um, ~see the whole process, see the leaves, and all that really helps you to really appreciate the journey that people make all around the world to make sure we have these [00:03:00] amazing gifts that we've talked about in the last ~nine, ~nine episodes.

Elizabeth Ashley: Well, I'm really quite blown away by that story 'cause I didn't know that story and what I've got in front of me. Here are some notes that I wrote for V when I've done actually, well, I can't find exact words now. One second. Smelling. Smelling wintergreen makes me feel like I'm sitting on the edge of an a Nepalese mountain surrounded by prayer flags, and I didn't even know where it was sourced from.

That's so strange. I'm really quite blown away by that. ~Um, ~yeah. ~Yeah. I had no idea that's where it came from.~ 

Adam Barallet: Yep. ~I have, ~I have two different varieties. I do have the Nepalese. ~Um, ~and then in the past we previously sourced, it does come from China, but that's a different species as well. So, ~um, ~this one does is more, ~uh, ~I think the oils.

~Look at the color~

is a bit, no, just a bit more still. The aroma is very, very similar, but it's blue. Whereas you will find the soft pink color in the Nepalese one, which is really beautiful and I think adds to its magic. We'll talk about as we go on [00:04:00] as well. 

Elizabeth Ashley: Do we know why they're different colors, 

Adam Barallet: ~different species?~

Different species, 

Elizabeth Ashley: ~but yeah. ~But so specifically what it's about the species that changes the color? 

Adam Barallet: ~No, to that. I do not know. ~So the chemistry would still be behind that methyl cell orate, which I know we're gonna talk a bit about today, but I'm not too sure to be honest. 

Elizabeth Ashley: No. So that makes me think, I dunno if I'm imagining this, but I kind of remember Dr.

Robert Papapa talking about there being a blue frankincense oil. If I remember rightly. And that was because it had been distilled in a copper limbic? 

Adam Barallet: Yes. I actually have a little bottle of that myself. ~Yeah.~ 

Elizabeth Ashley: So I wonder if it is maybe the distillation that's maybe different rather than chemistry ~or, I dunno.~

Adam Barallet: ~Possibly. ~Although the still they're using was just the average kind of metal, still it wasn't copper or anything like that. ~So. ~

Elizabeth Ashley: ~I'm talking about. ~I'm talking about the Chinese one. 

Adam Barallet: Ah. ~'cause~ 

Elizabeth Ashley: that's a blue. That's a blue oil. Said, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, leave it with me. ~Anyway. Anyway, ~so what do you know about the medicinal properties then of.

Meth, ~uh uh ~not methyl iLite of winter, [00:05:00] green, anything? 

Adam Barallet: ~Well, ~well because Winter Green is primarily methyl celly, ~I do kind of feel, you know, ~there are many essential oils that have a complex chemistry. Things like, ~um, you know, ~frankincense is a classic example of that, and I kind of do feel that winter green is a bit of a one tricked pony.

~Um, ~it's kind of an aches and pains oil, and that would pretty much be the main reason I would reach through it on a physical level. 

Elizabeth Ashley: So, well, I dunno if this is like a worldwide like expression, but my dad always used to say like, jack of all trades, master of none. ~Mm-hmm. ~And so like there's lots of oils that are jack of all trades, right?

That you just bring them out for anything but master of none. ~It's quite a skating. The thing, isn't it? It's like, so in which case, ~there are others that are masters and Winter Green, I would say he's a master. ~Um, ~interestingly, when I qualified back. ~When dinosaurs roam the earth, ~what? 1993? ~Uh, ~if you looked it up in tis ~uh, ~Tiran safety book, it would say This is a [00:06:00] hazardous oil.

~Uh, ~we were told this is not an oil that you use. ~Um, ~and it will become clear why that has changed over time. ~Um. ~It is quite a dangerous oil from the point of view that it has a lot of contraindications and it can interact with an awful lot of different things within the body. And because it's so high and methylate, which is, I'm looking at this chemistry here, the one in front of me, 98.74%.

So it's pretty neat, really. ~Um. ~If that goes somewhere, it shouldn't go, then you've got problems. Right? ~Um, ~but also because it's such a master and has been known to be a master for a very, very long time, it's in a lot of things that you use on a daily. In daily life, particularly if you are elderly, [00:07:00] because it is very good for, ~um, ~for aches and pains.

It's in a lot of lineaments. So for example, tiger Barn, which really makes sense to me now when you've said, right. Oh, China, Nepal. That's where they come from. Right? ~Um, ~and so. It's a strange situ, a strange situation because the energetics of are is it can create a cooling sensation in some people, which is not surprising 'cause it kind of does have a bit of a minty smell to it.

~Although it's not, it doesn't smell like mint. But you can kind of get that mintiness. ~Some people it's cooling and some people it's warming. And so that sort of clarification of changing the signaling through the circulatory system is really useful and very easily like made in a, in a cream or lotion also.

In fact, when I smell it, I very clearly smell. Al past, ~uh, um, ~toothpaste that it was like a, a [00:08:00] natural based toothpaste that my mom was so into in the seventies, ~you know, it was so much, ~you know, very, ~um, ~healthy, natural thing. And that's exactly what it smells like. It's in your ~po take ~toothpaste and it's there, so potentially you might ~be have, ~be using it in two different things.

Your daily life already. Now, ~the Linet might, uh uh, sorry. ~The toothpaste might not be that much of a problem because you're not really going to ingest it, right? You're just gonna clean your teeth, spit it out, and you do have this like really cold feeling in your mouth afterwards like you do with mint toothpaste.

But if you are having a lineament and you are already putting that on your body, and we'll talk about. More of the actions in a million. But if you are already putting that on your body, and then you also use Wintergreen essential oil, it's very, very easy to overdose, right? Mm-hmm. To complicate and confuse the system [00:09:00] of how much it should have.

And that's made even more complicated by the fact that Wintergreen is, ~um, ~like an English term. But actually it's a quite, ~uh, ~an important, ~um, ~medicine in some of, like the, the plains medicines, if I remember rightly. I'll look at my notes when I look down, but if I remember rightly, the Lakota people, for example, use it, ~uh, uh, use it.~

~Um, ~and they don't call it wintergreen, they call it tea berry. Or checker berry. So even if it's like not sort of annotated on something, you might not even know that it's there. And so this buildup of things in the system then becomes problematic. So why does it come problematic? Well, the first is that methyl salicylate, ~uh, ~is a precursor to, ~uh, ~salicylic acid, which is aspirin.

~So. ~Aspirin thins the blood. So [00:10:00] for example, other, I know a lot of people that'll take half an aspirin every day for its blood thinning properties to, ~uh, ~avoid strokes, for example. So if you are also using, ~um. ~You are half an aspirin and then you start using wintergreen on top of that. How problematic is that?

And I'm not sure that we actually know the answer to that. ~Um, and so there's so many like, but what ifs, methylate is. ~If we look at it from a chemical point of view, we often talk about ketones in on this program and what they do, but we very rarely talk about esters. One of the pharmaceutical properties of an ester is it actually affects how fast something will absorb through the skin.

~So ~this is also another reason why tiger bomb works so quickly, because it can get in really fast because ~the, uh, ~the esters will do that job. But if you affect ~something, uh, ~the speed of how something goes [00:11:00] through the skin. Then also what becomes an anomaly is how is that going to interact with drugs that are already circulating in the system.

Now, we've already talked about how we might have limit for aches and pains, but there's a specific interaction on the nervous system, which again, I'll come back to ~in a minute. We'll talk about its actions on the nervous system ~in a minute. What this means is it can really help with muscular pain and.

Relationship between nervous system and muscular pain because it interacts with, ~uh, ~the sodium iron gated channels which cause action potentials through the nervous system. So we often talk about these days we never did to begin with, but we often talk about the chemical, neuro, ~uh, ~nervous system [00:12:00] like neurotransmitters and we will.

In the moment. But there's also the, the older model of a nervous system that we knew about before was that it electrically signals, right? It sends electrical signals between the nerves and that relies on. The, the sodium ion channels and calcium ion channels, but sodium ion channels, ~um, ~actually being able to signal correctly.

So what happens is sodium goes into the, ~uh, ~into the cell and that depolarizes it and it set changes the charge of the cell and it sends an electrical charge quickly to the nerve or nerve from the nerve to the muscle. So these sodium, ~um, ~ion channels obviously have their own sort of receptors, and the one that we're most interested in here is NA V one two.

That is [00:13:00] on pretty much all of the cells in the no nervous system, all of the cells in the musculature system. On lymphatic system, on blood, ~uh, ~cells. So those, if you can imagine that ~the, ~the methylate actually communicates with pretty much every bodily system really quickly, and it does work fast. So one of the areas that I most like to use it is if I've got a really, really strong.

Sinus congestion and you know the ones that you're like, I cannot think straight. My hurt head hurts so much, it's so congested and there's nothing going through. And so I do everything that you are not supposed to do. I use one drop and diluted, which you're really not supposed to do, but a single drop on, just on.

If you feel and you go, ~where's the hurt bit? ~Where's the hurt bit? Just like. Two or three [00:14:00] seconds, it goes right through it and it smashes into pieces, but you feel it go right through your system. ~So that kind of. ~We don't really talk about it very often, but when we're ill, obviously our nervous system also goes, I just don't want to.

I just don't want to because your body wants you to go to bed, right? That's the whole thing. It's saying, I want you to stop working. I want you to stop doing all of those things that are gonna stop me dealing with that germ. So your nervous system tells you to do that, but. You do that ~and you ~and your nervous system gets a jolt, a massive, massive jolt.

Now because that happens, then we have to be really careful with people who might not react very well to that jolt. And specifically we are talking about people who have epilepsy. ~Um, ~so. ~One, ~once ~they have ~it has interacted with the sodium iron channels, it all then interacts with a [00:15:00] neurotransmitter GABA and specifically on GABA a receptors.

~And again, all through the system, all through the body, ~these are the body's calming receptors. So on paper you would think epilepsy. React well to react. This calming of the gaba, ~uh, ~sorry, this activation of the gabaa receptors. But because there's so much conflicting evidence, we just dunno. So it is fantastic at aches and pains.

It is absolutely incredible at circulatory problems. So if somebody has Ray's disease for example, and they have this colder, you know, the really react to cold winter berry makes perfect sense when you think about it. Winter green really is helpful for that. ~Um, ~and if you have like [00:16:00] congestion in your belly, so you've got really bad indigestion.

~Again, we just use the smallest amounts, so. ~Maximum dilution is actually not that low. So ti around and young say 2.4. So I would go 2% just to be on the safe side. So you're going a table spoon of carrier oil, two drops of that will keep you at 2% and you just like massaging it on your belly or things like thrombosis.

Really were a really active, like react well to winter green. And what's interesting about the interaction there is what you would say is winter green essential oil is really good for massage, but. Massage over thrombosis would be contraindicated. That's one of the areas that we don't massage because the veins are too close to the to [00:17:00] the surface.

So just having a massage on and just gently rubbing it on and take your hands off. Leave the oil to do the work. So there are so many ways to use this oil. I would say that it's more an old person's oil than a young person's oil. If you are young and healthy and virile, really, you probably don't ever need to use it except for, oh my God, I've got a cold.

And you would be really careful. You really shouldn't do neat on this, on the top of your head, ~but I do. But um, you know, ~if ~you just. Did the same as ~you did the, ~the, the teaspoon or even tablespoon of oil. Well, yeah, I should have said teaspoon earlier, not tablespoon. ~Teaspoon of oil with two drops in would be 2%.

And then just rub that on the head. You can do what the body doesn't want you to go do. You can go to work and do those things, but then please go to bed because that's what the body wants you to do. But it gets you over the river at the time of crisis if you like. 

Adam Barallet: Very much so. ~Uh, ~so yeah, I remember actually a couple of years ago you did teach me the winter green on the top of the head, [00:18:00] so I know I have that in my usage notes for sure.

So just to come back to it, it can, ~um, ~be a contraindication on certain medications. Now, obviously you and I are not doctors, so we don't know exactly how every pharmaceutical works. ~Um, ~but ~1, ~1, 1 challenge I find sometimes when, ~um, ~we talk to doctors is when they don't know anything about essential oils, they just go best.

You don't use it. And because I just like better safe than sorry, kind of approach. But you saying that where Wintergreen is kind of majorly contraindicated is epilepsy, but also if you are on anything to do with blood thinning ~or, or, ~or of the blood kind of that, that's where you'd steer away from Wintergreen.

Yeah. 

Elizabeth Ashley: Well, yes. Now I'm just seeing, okay, so, ~um. ~As I say, this is off the thing that I did for a company. So it says, since this absorption then affects how things circulate in the body, it changes the way drugs engage in the liver, kidney, and the heart as such, then for any [00:19:00] kind of liver, kidney, or heart conditions.

We're going to leave Winter green, essential oil alone. So actually, no, it's a lot more ~comp, uh, like ~complex than that, isn't it? So ~it's a se ~it's a strange one, isn't it? Because like I say, it's an old person's oil. It's not really a young person's oil. And the old people are the ones that are on the medications.

They're the ones that have got the blood pressure medications. They're the ones on the statins. So we really like approach it with real care. And remember, of course, that ~e ~essential oil usage is cumulative, right? ~So you might. Do this thing on the top of your head and then you won't use it again. ~Well, we're not really interested in how that's gonna interact with the liver, if I'm honest, and probably get thrown out every organization for saying that publicly, but.

~I, ~I wouldn't be, but if somebody ~was ~came to me who got really bad aches and pains ~and I was like, I wanted them ~maybe arthritis, for example, and I wanted them [00:20:00] to use a cream three times a day, ~every time, ~every day for six weeks, then yeah, I'm really gonna be looking ~very, ~very closely at the drugs that they're on to say, ~uh, is it, ~is it good?

Is it not good? 

Adam Barallet: So you're saying it's an old person's essential oil, but you know, young fit adults, so they may be quite active, exercising, going to the gym, different things like that. They've got aches and pains if you are making up a blend or if you're using a couple of essential oils to kind of relieve those tight muscles.

~Um, whether it be injured muscles from exercising or just tight muscles from being at a desk. ~Is winter green a goer or are there other alternatives you'd reach for first? 

Elizabeth Ashley: Yeah, I think it's a good one, especially with something like Black Pepper. Can you imagine the effects of that on your circulation would be fantastic.

However, personally, I'd be wanting to know how it felt on their skin. ~I wouldn't be. This is one of your questions that should have primed me for, because I would wanna think it out before I just did this, but ~if you put a pot of cream on a shelf and selled it for that, I don't think you would be able to predict how it would feel [00:21:00] on their skin.

Because it can be warm and it could be cooling. 

Adam Barallet: Yeah. 

Elizabeth Ashley: And if you put black pepper with it too, black pepper's really interesting 'cause it's warming and stimulating, but it's not an irritant. But if you put it with cinnamon bark, for example, dunno, I don't know. But I would say, yeah, I would say it's a good one.

~I would just do my trick that I. Is my cop out trick it sounds like. But actually it's a really powerful thing. ~I was brought up by two aroma therapists, one of whom Michael Cook. Should have actually had a different license associated with him because he was just so fascinated by oils he shouldn't be touching.

~Um, ~and he loved, ~uh, uh, ~wintergreen and he also loved Birch, which I know is one that you really love. And again, that's one that we would say be a bit careful because of the methyl sate. And he would make these preparations doing it with dowsing incidentally rather than like prescriptive, although he knew the prescriptive, like nobody's business, but he always did it through dowsing.

So he would have a formula or a [00:22:00] prescription that maybe would have 20, 30, 40 oils in them. And when he dowsed the number of oils like drops to use, you might have like rose uranium. Lemon five drops me, but Wintergreen would only be ever be one drop. ~Mm. ~And it's like, it wants to be this kind of backup note that hums in the background.

And so what I quite often do is I do my one 15th of a drop. ~So, um, we call it a homeopathic dose, which. ~Actually, it's very good for using, for accessing the spiritual aspects of an essential oil because the more dilute that you get, it's almost like you pull down the, the physical stuff so you can't access it and you just have like this, well, the prayer flags in the breeze.

It's a great analogy. It's almost like that's what you're getting. In this case, you would also really mediate your problems with contraindications. So one 15th of a drop in [00:23:00] another blend for something like a muscle rub. Really clever, I think. ~Um, and so ~if it's not clear how you do one 15th of a drop, count out 14 drops of carrier oil, ~just little drops, ~then add one drop of wintergreen, then use one drop of that blend.

That is one 15. ~Um, and I do actually have, this actually is one of those, it's a blended, uh, ~it's very sticky. So, but it's actually blended, ~so it's, um. ~I've done, I can't remember what the maths is to do five mil, but I've done it like maybe three mil of carrier oil, then calculated how many drops go into three mil, and then I use one drop of that and I can still, I mean, it's really, really strong smelling.

You would still get that note coming through in any blend, but ~it, ~it really mediates your safety and I think. The deeper that you go into aromatherapy. ~I, ~I love the phrase, the more you know, the more you realize you dunno. Having these ~like ~structures in place of going, I really could make a mess of that is really helpful to me ~to kind of, like I said before, I, um, have.~

[00:24:00] New bottles of oil, of, ~uh, ~citruses coming regularly so that I don't get myself into trouble with, ~um, ~skin sensitivity, but also these ones where the safety can be a bit dodgy. I have two bottles. I have the one ~that's, ~that's full of all the oil and then also my mediated one that I can go out, I don't have to worry about sitting here and counting out to one 15th of drop.

I've got that ready. 

Adam Barallet: ~Mm-hmm. ~Mm-hmm. So let's have a little bit of a look at it. More kind of holistic aspects. ~Um, ~what I love about this oil is, you know, it's very classic in what we use it for physically that we've already discussed, and that kind of translates into the holistic as well. ~So ~what I've found in my years of combining aromatherapy and terror reading is what I love to do is when different cards come up, you know, sometimes you get people that will not be so forthcoming with the information.

So you ask a question, go, the cards are suggesting this. ~Sometimes they're a bit like, I don't know. ~But what I've found over time is when people have a disliking of an essential oil, as long as they don't have a prior history, like their, you know, [00:25:00] their grandmother used winter grid and she also used to beat them or something like that kind of thing, but do you know what I mean?

As long as there's no negative emotional experience, if they don't like the smell of that, that always shows me something on an emotional level that's not quite right. The group of the population who do not like wintergreen time and time again. Are control freaks. They hate it. It's really, really interesting because what Wintergreen allows you to do is just as it allows the body to surrender or to release all the pain or the tightness from the body.

It also emotionally allows you to do that as well. So for individuals who feel like they need to actually kind of control things ~and ~and need to know what's happening and like to be the one in control, winter green's a really great oil for them to work with. Now, if they've got parts of the body that they wanna massage it into, that could help, but they're probably not gonna like the smell of it.

So what they can do is massaging it onto the soles of their feet at night, just a drop of it. And you will find over time on a [00:26:00] metaphysical magical level that's actually helping you to build that relationship with something you have an ~adver ~adversity to. ~Now ~this can apply ~it ~to, if you just like to be in control of your life, ~you can be, you know, ~most of the time when ~I go, ~people go, I don't like the smell of winter green.

~And ~I jokingly say. You are a bit of a control freak. ~They, I, yeah, I am. They, they, ~they admit it. So most of the time people know, but it's also really good for people that are maybe, you know, I think of like meddling mother-in-laws or bossy people who always have to tell everyone the right way to do things.

Winter, green, like you said, you are feeling rather chilled and it does on so many levels. Just help us to chill out a little bit more, realize that we can control some things. Focus on them. There are some things that we can't control or shouldn't be trying to control 'cause it's someone else's business and it just really allows us to surrender and let that go ~and, ~and rebalance that harmony.

Does that make sense? 

Elizabeth Ashley: Makes perfect sense. And I can actually articulate that scientifically for you. ~Um, it's, that's very clever, Adam. Um, ~so if you think about what I said, that it's really good for massage, for [00:27:00] example. That's one of the things ~that, ~that a lot of people will lie on the couch and just still not be able to relax.

And so that is one of ~the, um, ~the reasons that we would use it. And remember how I said that it goes through the gaba a, ~uh, ~receptor. Well, those are all the way through the system, ~so. ~I can imagine that they can feel themselves from the moment they smell it. 'cause remember, we're looking about five seconds from the oil to get to the brain to go.

They feel that going and go. Nope. Nope. It's almost like that feeling of falling in a dream, you know, like that. That's a shock to the system. I'm so, so controlled and I'm so holding things in my body of structure and rigor that that feels horrible, like coming across your body because your brain knows these things faster than you can actually say the words, doesn't it?

~That's really clever.~ 

Adam Barallet: Yeah. One thing that popped into my head, because of this ability for us to help us to kind of just release and relax. Do you think you could somehow use it in [00:28:00] blends for fragility and sexual coldness or intimacy on paper? ~In, in the background? I, I, ~I wouldn't ~make, ~make it the main ingredient, and I don't think you're gonna win anyone over with the smell of a men's locker room, which we agree.

No, 

Elizabeth Ashley: ~no. And, but more, more than that. It's like, it's like an old man's line, you know? I, I think that like, that's where. ~The difference between aromatherapy and essential oils is huge, because if you read that on paper, you would go, that would be great, but actually no, it has no sexual component. But also your brain will immediately smell that and go, that smells like my granddad.

Why would you want to have sex then? Right. 

Adam Barallet: True. True. ~I, I'm, ~I'm wondering if you could ~hide it, ~hide it behind some nicer aromas like geranium rose. ~Ang. ~I don't know. We'd have to have a try. ~Nah,~ 

Elizabeth Ashley: we've covered lots better oils. Like tubes, like Jasmine, like Oz. 

Adam Barallet: Yeah. 

Elizabeth Ashley: And that's what they're for, right? Yeah.

You don't [00:29:00] need to try and put it into a pigeon hole. It's already got a really, if you were like, it's like saying. ~The CEO of Lloyd's Bank. ~Do you think he could do like a checkout at Aldi? Well, yeah, he can. But why? Why is he gonna, you know? 

Adam Barallet: Yeah, yeah. But we're not gonna turn Thomas Anderson into a, an amazing soccer player or football player, are we?

~No, he~ 

Elizabeth Ashley: doesn't need to. ~He's got a perfectly good job already.~ 

Adam Barallet: True, true. Yeah. ~So, ~so one of the other great things about Wintergreen, because of the surrender, so it can be really good for control. Issues. ~Um, ~you know, maybe if we're looking astrologically ~a ~and kind of profiling the different zodiac signs for Virgos, it could be a really good one who Virgos, you know, in their caring nature and trying to get the world perfect and imbalanced.

They can be a little bit controlling and meddling. ~Um, but also ~it can actually be used as an abundance oil as well. ~Now again, ~there are better oils for general abundance, citruses and, ~um, ~so on that you might reach for Bergamot's an amazing one. ~But again, ~sometimes when we decide we wanna manifest something in our lives, we're like, right, I want that lover.

I want that job. I want that car. I want that house. [00:30:00] What we do is, it's great to be clear with the universe, but sometimes we can almost get the tunnel vision on where we get that specific, that there may actually be better options out there. Some people, when they're using, they're doing their magical work or the affirmation work, they always say, I want this, or something better.

So I'd really like a house like that or something better. And they're open to that. And Wintergreen could be a good one there for, again, if you are trying to control, like you sit under the full moon and you say, full moon, bring me a new lover. And ~then, ~then the next day you're at work bugging the guy that you've got a crush on going, I've done my full moon work.

Come on. Why isn't it working on him? 'cause there may be someone better so it, it can actually open our. Point of view and surrender and trust the universe that maybe everything, as we know in retrospect, we often see that everything is unfolding exactly how it should be. I was talking to a friend recently about trying to get a rental and she's missed out on a rental, and I said, every time I've missed out on a rental home [00:31:00] throughout my life.

The one I've ended up in has been so much better than the one I was really upset about getting kind of thing, and probably, you know, we could apply that to our love life and other aspects of our life as well. So if you do need to surrender, I'd really love to hammer that word home. Surrender for winter green.

~It can help you on that level as well. ~I 

Elizabeth Ashley: ~think that's exactly right. ~I mean, obviously I was doing more work. Thinking about ~this, uh, ~this episode, and I was thinking, I don't really know what the astrological like. Rulership would be, and I was thinking, well, maybe it's neptunian, you know, that open, sort of, but ~it, it's not, ~it's not, it doesn't misdirect, it's not confusing.

So, no, the only thing that I could come up with. Is Jupiter for that expansion, like that higher knowledge and almost like that elevation above being able to look down from a bird's eye view rather than trying to look up in tunnel ~vision. ~Vision. So you've articulated that better, but that is [00:32:00] exactly what ~the, ~I came up with too.

Adam Barallet: Yeah, ~I I think that's really, yeah, that ~it is definitely ~it. It's ~an opening oil ~it ~for the body. It ~opens, you know, ~opens us up from muscle constriction and it also. Opens us up from mental constriction, spiritual ~con, um, ~constriction and also emotional constriction as well. The final thing, especially, ~I should, you know, ~I should have been well prepared, so I was talking about these two different types.

So the Chinese type I have is, ~um, ~Etherium God, pro cumbents. 

Elizabeth Ashley: Pro cumbents, yeah. ~Yes.~ 

Adam Barallet: Whereas ~the, ~the Nepalese one, the pink one is G Fraga Tima. ~So~ 

Elizabeth Ashley: scented. So potentially is more scented, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. So most people, most people, if you are buying your oil from somewhere other than doTERRA, you are gonna find gout area cumbents.

Yeah. Yeah. ~Um, ~and actually. I don't know whether you are, you said this at the beginning or not, but I was really shocked to find out what it was when I [00:33:00] started to learn about it. 'cause it smells like a mint to me. I mean, I keep saying that, but it doesn't smell like mint. But it kind of, in the same way that petou doesn't smell like a mint, but it is a mint.

I was kind of expecting that, but it's like a, an evergreen shrub, like shrub with really glossy leaves, isn't it? And, and berries almost like. Missile toe, like a Christmas decoration, is it? No. 

Adam Barallet: ~Like, like, ~well it kind of reminds me of ~like ~missile toe or holly or something. 

Elizabeth Ashley: ~Right? Yeah. So like a winter. Yeah.~

And so, and I really had not guessed that at all. ~Yeah,~ 

Adam Barallet: yeah. No, it's really interesting. So yeah, from emotional, really great, especially ~the, ~the Deese one without pink essence for, I'd normally use Wintergreen probably with that control aspect. I do love it for the solar Plexus chakra. But the pink one, I think you can move up to the heart as well.

Really good for any resentment or any hurt of the heart, heartbreak or anything where ~you, again, ~the heart is holding on and going, no, ~I'm not. ~I'm not willing to move on from that injustice that happened to me in my romantic [00:34:00] or emotional, ~um, ~or love life. I think it would be great for that as well. 

Elizabeth Ashley: Yeah, I think that, ~uh, I think ~if you would like to try and encapsulate it in the tiniest, ~tiniest, like ~keyword release and flow works very good ~on the emo, ~on the emotional level, on the physical level, ~I think, ~I think that's a good encapsulation.

Adam Barallet: I would say release, I would say flow and I would definitely say surrender as well. So ~that kind of more opening up and just allowing a little bit more. ~It's really great as well. So, 

Elizabeth Ashley: mm ~mm~ 

Adam Barallet: Yeah, it's, ~it's ~

Elizabeth Ashley: ~so, so actually lemme ask then, because I get asked this a lot. ~If somebody wanted to buy that pink one from you, how can they buy it if they're not in Australia?

Adam Barallet: Yeah, that's a great thing. doTERRA obviously being an international company, they have, ~um, ~warehouses all around the world. ~Now, don't just jump thread on their website because then you'll pay the full price. ~The great thing is doTERRA uses Advocate Site myself, so you'll find my details obviously below in the links.

Click on that, reach out to me, and you can be anywhere in the world. You can be Australia, uk, America, middle East, Asia. ~We, ~we can get it to you anywhere in the world ~type of thing. ~So yeah, it's an amazing essential order to work with and ~it, ~it's helped a lot of people with [00:35:00] their aches and pains ~and, ~and their heartache as well.

Excellent. Very interesting. Well, that's 99 Oil done and Dusted. ~Um, ~we must admit, we, we were going through our list and checking off and we were kind of shocked. We hadn't done Winter Green. It's slipped under the radar somehow, but we definitely got into our top 100 oils. Don't forget, we have lots more in store.

We've got a special episode coming up for number a hundred. And then we've got some exciting things happening after that as well. The key thing is, so you don't miss ~a fi a, ~a single little snippet of goodness. You wanna make sure that you like each video, you subscribe to us, so you hit the little bell and the algorithms and the robots, and the mice, and all those different things.

And the angels will ensure that you don't miss out on finding out one iota of information about an amazing gift from. ~Uh, ~mother Earth and her essential oils before we disappear, anything we need to remind them of Liz? 

Elizabeth Ashley: ~Um, ~I guess I didn't say whether you should, ~uh, ~use it in pregnancy, so [00:36:00] it would be all right after, ~um, ~16 weeks, but I would say don't use it in pregnancy.

Adam Barallet: ~Yeah. Awesome. Well, we hope you enjoyed that. ~Let us know in the comment section below. Until next week, we'll see you soon. Take care and blessed be 

Elizabeth Ashley: Bye-bye.
