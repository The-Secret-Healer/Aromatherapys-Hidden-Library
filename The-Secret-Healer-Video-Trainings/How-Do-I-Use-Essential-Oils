# How Do I Use Essential Oils?

Welcome! I‚Äôm Elizabeth Ashley‚ÄîUK Director for the National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA), author of *The Secret Healer Aromatherapy Manuals*, and your guide in bringing authentic, lineage-rooted aromatherapy into your daily life.

This guide draws from classical aromatherapy traditions, focusing on holistic, non-pharmaceutical approaches to wellness using therapeutic-grade essential oils like *Lavandula angustifolia* (Lavender), *Melaleuca alternifolia* (Tea Tree), and *Cymbopogon flexuosus* (Lemongrass).

Over decades in clinical practice, I‚Äôve found many newcomers ask me the same thing:  
**‚ÄúHow do I actually use essential oils safely at home?‚Äù**  
This video answers exactly that, cutting through online misinformation and sharing practical wisdom from traditional use.

## üìù What You‚Äôll Learn in This Video

In this beginner-friendly video, I‚Äôll personally guide you through:

- ‚úÖ **Why proper dilution matters**, to prevent irritation and maximise therapeutic benefit
- ‚úÖ **Everyday applications**, including:
   - Massage oils and creams
   - Bath oils and bath salts (and why I‚Äôll never forget the lemon incident!)
   - Diffuser blends
   - Candle scenting for mood shifts

## ‚úÖ Why This Matters

Essential oils are more than just pleasant smells‚Äîthey interact deeply with your nervous system, endocrine system, and emotions.  
When used wisely:
- They ease discomfort and stress
- Help balance mood and sleep
- Improve focus and mental clarity
- Offer a natural tool for everyday wellbeing

This is traditional aromatherapy as I was trained to practice it: safe, gentle, and profoundly effective.
