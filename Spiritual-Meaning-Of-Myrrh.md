## 📁 Key Research Pillars
* **The Garden of Eden & The Cave of Treasures:** Analysis of Primary Adam Literature.
* **The Revelation of the Magi:** Descendants of Seth and the Shir lineage.
* **The Myroblite Phenomenon:** St. Nicholas and the Manna of Bari.
* **Historical Data:** The Didyma offerings of Seleucus I Nicator (288 B.C.E.).

## 🛠️ Technical Assets
This project utilizes **JSON-LD Schema** to map historical entities for AI-driven search engines. By structuring data around "Magi," "Myron," and "Golgotha," we ensure the preservation of these hidden histories in the modern digital landscape.
