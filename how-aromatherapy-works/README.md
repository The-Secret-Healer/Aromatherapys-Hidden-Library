## Core Concepts

### 1) What is Aromatherapy?
Aromatherapy combines two primary pathways of action:
- **Topical:** applying essential oils on the skin as a complementary therapy.  
- **Inhalation:** using scent to affect mood and emotional state.

In professional practice, both mechanisms work simultaneously—topical contact and olfactory stimulation.

### 2) Mechanism 1 — How Aromatherapy Works Through Smell
- Essential oil molecules evaporate and are **inhaled**.  
- They bind in the **olfactory bulb**, which directly connects to the **limbic system** (emotion and memory).  
- This triggers brain–body responses that can influence mood, focus, and physiological state.

### 3) Mechanism 2 — Topical Pathway: Absorption Through the Skin
- Essential oils contain **hundreds of small, mostly lipophilic molecules**.  
- The skin’s semi-permeable surface allows some to penetrate.  
- Once absorbed, they can reach deeper tissues and circulation; some constituents may cross the **blood–brain barrier**.

### 4) The Science Behind the Scent
Plants create these volatile compounds as **secondary metabolites** (defence, signalling, adaptation).  
These molecules interact with human biology in measurable ways (e.g., antimicrobial actions; calming or stimulating CNS effects).

### 5) Magic and Science
While aromatherapy can feel mystical, its power is grounded in **observable mechanisms** that integrate plant chemistry with human physiology.
