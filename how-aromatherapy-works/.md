## Core Concepts

### 1. What is Aromatherapy?
Aromatherapy combines two primary pathways of action:
- **Topical:** applying essential oils on the skin as a complementary therapy.  
- **Inhalation:** using scent to affect mood and emotional state.  

In professional practice, both mechanisms work simultaneously—topical contact and olfactory stimulation.

---

### 2. Mechanism 1 — How Aromatherapy Works Through Smell
- Essential oil molecules evaporate into the air and are **inhaled**.  
- They land on the **olfactory bulb**, which directly connects to the **limbic system**, the brain’s emotional and memory centre.  
- This triggers biochemical and neurological responses influencing mood, focus, and physiological state (e.g., lowering blood pressure during relaxation).

---

### 3. Mechanism 2 — Topical Pathway: Absorption Through the Skin
- Essential oils are composed of **hundreds of small molecules**.  
- The skin’s semi-permeable surface allows these molecules to penetrate.  
- Once absorbed, they can enter the bloodstream and reach deeper tissues.  
- Some constituents can cross the **blood–brain barrier**, affecting the central nervous system directly.

### 4. The Science Behind the Scent
Plants create essential oils as **chemical defence systems**—repelling predators, regulating hydration, and modulating ecological interactions.  
These secondary metabolites, evolved for plant survival, incidentally interact with human biology in beneficial ways, showing antimicrobial, calming, or stimulating actions.

---

### 5. Magic and Science
Elizabeth Ashley highlights that while aromatherapy may feel mystical, its real power comes from **measurable mechanisms**.  
It operates at the intersection of plant intelligence and human physiology—**a synergy of nature’s chemistry and human perception**.
